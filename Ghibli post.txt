As you all may have encountered for the past week, every single LinkedIn influencer has been talking about AI image generators copying Studio Ghibli art style is bad for the environment and other stuff. 

While their intentions may be good, it is yet another attempt to farm impressions with a lot of misleading information, making claims without citing their references, and worst of all when running their posts through any AI detector 8 out of 10 times says it is likely generated by AI. 



Disclaimer: 

1. I am claiming all posts regarding AI image generators are just another slop for impression farming.

2. AI Detectors are prone to false positives, do check on your own.

3. I am not HVAC certified or a power management expert. However i do have experience building/working with PC's & GPU's

4. I am writing this on my own without the use of AI, check using AI detectors  to confirm.

5. I do not work for any of the AI image generating companies nor am I sponsored by any.



Now that all the disclaimer and intro to the topic are all done lets discuss the key misleading points that I have seen circulating all over LinkedIn.
